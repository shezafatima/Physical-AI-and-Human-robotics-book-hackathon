# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where AI systems are designed to interact with and understand the physical world in real-time. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI systems must navigate, manipulate, and reason about physical objects and environments.

## Key Characteristics of Physical AI

- **Embodied Cognition**: AI systems that exist in and interact with physical environments
- **Real-time Processing**: Ability to process sensory information and respond in real-time
- **Multi-modal Integration**: Combining vision, touch, sound, and other sensory inputs
- **Action-Perception Loops**: Continuous cycles of action and environmental feedback

## Applications in Robotics

Physical AI is particularly crucial for robotics applications, enabling robots to:

- Navigate complex environments
- Manipulate objects with precision
- Adapt to changing conditions
- Interact safely with humans

## Physical AI vs Traditional AI

| Traditional AI | Physical AI |
|----------------|-------------|
| Operates on digital data | Interacts with physical world |
| Batch processing | Real-time processing |
| Static environments | Dynamic environments |
| Limited sensory input | Multi-sensory integration |
